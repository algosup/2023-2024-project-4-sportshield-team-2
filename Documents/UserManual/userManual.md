# General Info and Specifications

## Components


Here's a list of the components a SportShield device contains:
- Xiao BLE Sense nrf52840
- GNSS PA1010D
- GSM/2G SIM800L Module
- Electromagnet
- Piezoelectric Buzzer
- Lithium-Polymer Battery
- NFC Antenna

## Robustness Assurance

Since the SportShield is an anti-theft device, it has to be resistant enough, meeting some resistance criteria.
<!-- Waterproofness, cold-resistance, and robustness against break-in attempts. -->

### Anti-theft Cable

**The cable in itself got some adjustments to meet the resistance criteria.** 
For physical security, a multi-layered cable and electromagnetic lock have been implemented.<br>
Moreover, the cable automatically retracts into the housing and prevents unwinding when locked.

## Environmental conditions

<!-- 3 days autonomy in ambient environment (60% more consumption in cold environment) -->

## Security

SportShield prioritizes the fundamental principles encapsulated within the AIC triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

Confidentiality, akin to the notion of privacy, serves as the bedrock of SportShield's approach to safeguarding sensitive information. By meticulously categorizing data based on its potential impact if compromised, SportShield enforces stringent measures to thwart unauthorized access attempts, ensuring that confidential data remains secure and inaccessible to unauthorized entities.

Integrity stands as a pillar of trustworthiness within SportShield's framework. Throughout the lifecycle of data, from creation to dissemination, SportShield employs robust mechanisms to uphold the consistency and accuracy of information. By fortifying data against unauthorized alterations, such as those that might occur during data breaches or in transit, SportShield guarantees the integrity of critical information.

Availability, the third facet of the AIC triad, underscores SportShield's commitment to ensuring that authorized parties can access information promptly and consistently. Through diligent maintenance of hardware, technical infrastructure, and systems, SportShield endeavors to eliminate downtime and disruptions, thereby enabling seamless access to vital data whenever and wherever it is needed.
