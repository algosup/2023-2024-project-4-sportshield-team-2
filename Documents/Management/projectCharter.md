## Overview of the project

The project was commissioned by [CORIS Innovation](https://www.corisinnovation.com) from [ALGOSUP](https://algosup.com/en.html) students, and involved software maintenance. The software is an application for securing sports equipment, which is implemented on hardware supplied by the company.

The students will be using C++ programming languages, as well as C, to maintain and improve the existing software.

## Components

The company CORIS Innovation therefore provides students with hardware allowing them to work on a physical prototype. The components supplied are as follows:

- [Xiao BLE Sense nrf52840](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_BLE/)
- [GNSS PA1010D](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/084/295/original/CD_PA1010D_Datasheet_v.03.pdf?1573833002)
- [GSM/2G SIM800L Module](https://lastminuteengineers.com/sim800l-gsm-module-arduino-tutorial/?utm_content=cmp-true)
- [Electromagnet](https://www.amazon.com/Atoplee-Electric-Assembly-Solenoid-27X29X18mm/dp/B01FH1JCPU)
- [Piezoelectric Buzzer](https://www.amazon.com/Buzzer-piezoelectric-Electronic-Audible-Continuous/dp/B09XCYY7C2)
- [Lithium-Polymer Battery](http://www.fullwat.com/documentos/000497-LNK02811.pdf)
- [NFC Antenna](https://www.molex.com/en-us/products/part-detail/1462360031)

All components are assumed to work, and to have no physical or software defects in order to be able to function perfectly during all the tests.

## Deliverables

Throughout the six weeks of work, all of the following documents must be made public so that the company can check the progress of the project in real time. The milestones are therefore:

- Final Product Delivery
- Functional Specifications Document
- Technical Specifications Document
- The Test Plan
- The Database of Bug
- Unit Tests
- The Architecture Diagram
- All the Weekly Reports and Management Planning

The final project must therefore be submitted by the 10th of April 2024 at 5PM.

## Scopes

By following the requests of the client company, the students will focus on the following points of the project:

- Manage the battery: The objective here is to be able to properly manage the battery so that it lasts as long as possible without recharging.
- Manage security issues: Several security problems are present within the current software, the objective is to resolve as many basic errors as possible to prevent the end user from having access to the software.
- Have an NFC: One of the client company's requests is to be able to activate/deactivate the locking mechanism without using the phone.
- Manage multiple events in real time: The software provided by the company is not able to stop the alarm directly when the software has been deactivated, the system is unlocked but the alarm nevertheless continues to sound.
- Notification: Students must therefore make sure to manage movements, and know when to send a notification to the user to warn them when their equipment has moved.

## Time Management

The team is made up of 6 students, who between them share a total of 504 hours over the total duration of the 6 weeks of the project.

## Budget

Students do not have to incur any expenses throughout the project. All expenses related to the project are covered by the company CORIS Innovation. The expenses only consist of the purchase of Hardware equipment in the event of breakage.
