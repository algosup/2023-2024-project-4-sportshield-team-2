## Week 1 (11-15 March 2024)

[week 1](weeklyReportFirstWeek.md)

The first week was dedicated to initiating the project and planning. The team discuss about project and the tasks to be done. The functional specifications document was started. The team also began to reverse-engineer the existing software to understand how it works.

## Topics of the first week

1. Read and analyse the call for tender.
2. Meeting with the group to discuss the project.
3. Begin to write the functional specifications document.
4. Reverse engineering of the existing software.
5. Gather questions we have about the project
6. Ask the client for a meeting to clarify some points.

## Achievements of the first week

1. Kick-off presentation by the client.
    - The client presented the project to the team.
    - Analyse the call for tender

2. Documents
    - The functional specifications are well advanced.
    - The project charter is complete.
    - The test plan has been started.
    - The user manual has been started.
    - The RACI matrix has been created.
    - The technical specifications document has been started.

3. Hardware components
    - The team has received all the hardware components.
    - The team has tested the hardware components.
    - The team has started to work on the hardware components.

4. Reverse engineering
    - The team has started to reverse engineer the existing software.

## Challenges of the first week

1. Hardware part
    - The team had some trouble with the hardware, as the components were not working as expected.
    - The team decided to take other components that were working properly.
    - Also certain functions in the code were not working as expected.
2. Reverse engineering
    - The team had some trouble with the reverse engineering of the existing software mainly because of the hardware components.
3. Working for a real company
    - For some of the team members, it was their first time working for a real company, so it's different for them but they are adapting.

## Plan for the second week

1. Documents
    - Finish the functional specifications document on Monday.
    - Add the KPIs to the management documents.
    - Continue the test plan.
    - Continue the user manual.
    - Begin the statement of work.

2. Hardware components
    - Solve the problems with the SIM card.
3. Client meeting
    - Have a meeting with the client to clarify some points.

## Conclusion of the first week

The first week was a good start for the project. The team has started to work on the documents and the hardware components. The team has also started to reverse-engineer the existing software. The team is looking forward to the next week to continue the work.

## Week 2 (18-22 March 2024)

[week 2](weeklyReportSecondWeek.md)

The second week was devoted to testing all the project components. The team discussed the project and how we would manage to produce the project without the hardware breaking down. The functional specifications document was completed. The team also continued to reverse engineer the existing software with LEDs to try and implement all the functionality of the project.

## Topics of the second week

1. Test all components.
2. Meeting with client to discuss hardware.
3. Finish writing technical specifications.
4. Continue reverse engineering existing software with LEDs.
5. Attempt to implement project functionality without hardware but with LEDs.

## Achievements of the second week

1. Test all the components.
   - The team tested all the components.
   - The team found some problems with the hardware components
   - The team decided to use LEDs to test the project's functionality.

2. Documents
   - The technical specifications are well advanced.
   - The test plan is well advanced.
   - The user manual has been continued with the information available to us.

3. Hardware components

   - The team tested all the hardware components for each team to see if they worked.

   - The team tried to solve the problems without success and therefore decided to use LEDS to simulate the functionality of the project.

4. Reverse engineering
   - The team went on to reverse-engineer the existing software using LEDs to test the project's functionality.

## Challenges of the second week

1. Hardware part
   - The team encountered difficulties with the hardware, as the components did not work as expected.
2. Reverse engineering
   - The team had some difficulties with the reverse engineering of the existing software, mainly because of the hardware components.
3. Working for a real company
   - For some members of the team, this was the first time they had worked for a real company, so it was different for them, but they were adapting.

## Plan for the third week

1. Documents
   - Finish the technical specifications document on Tuesday.
   - Continue the test plan.
   - Continue user manual.
   - Begin Statement of Work.
2. Hardware components
   - The team will continue to work on the hardware components with the LEDs.

## Conclusion of the second week

The second week was a bit complicated with the hardware problems but we tried to solve them with LEDs to simulate each state apart from the battery. The team continued to work on the documents, in particular the technical plan and the test plan. The team has also started to reverse-engineer the existing software with LEDs. The team is motivated to continue next week's work with the LEDs and to look for a way to create a library for the NFC software.
