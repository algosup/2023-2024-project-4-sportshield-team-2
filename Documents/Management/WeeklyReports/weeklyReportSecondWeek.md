## Week 2 (18-22 March 2024)

The second week was devoted to testing all the project components. The team discussed the project and how we would achieve it without the hardware breaking down. The functional specifications document was completed. The team also continued to reverse engineer the existing software with LEDs to try and implement all the functionality of the project.

## This week's topics

1. Test all components.
2. Meeting with the client to discuss hardware.
3. Finish writing technical specifications.
4. Continue reverse engineering existing software with LEDs.
5. Attempt to implement project functionality without hardware but with LEDs.

## Achievements

1. Test all the components.
   - The team tested all the components.
   - The team found some problems with the hardware components
   - The team decided to use LEDs to test the project's functionality.

2. Documents
   - The technical specifications are well advanced.
   - The test plan is well advanced.
   - The user manual has been continued with the information available to us.

3. Hardware components
   - The team tested all the hardware components of each team to see if they worked.
   - The team tried to solve the problems without success and decided to use LEDS to simulate the functionality of the project.

4. Reverse engineering
   - The team continued to reverse-engineer the existing software using LEDs to test the project's functionality.

## Challenges

1. Hardware part
   - The team encountered difficulties with the hardware, as the components did not work as expected.
2. Reverse engineering
   - The team encountered difficulties with the reverse-engineering of the existing software, mainly because of the hardware components.
3. Working for a real company
   - For some members of the team, this was the first time they had worked for a real company, so it was different for them, but they adapted.

## Next week's plan

1. Documents
   - Finish the technical specifications document on Tuesday.
   - Continue the test plan.
   - Continue user manual.
   - Begin Statement of Work.
2. Hardware components
   - The team will continue to work on the hardware components with the LEDs.

## Conclusion

The second week was a bit complicated with the hardware problems, but we tried to solve them with LEDs to simulate each state, with the exception of the battery. The team continued to work on the documents, in particular the technical plan and the test plan. The team has also started to reverse-engineer the existing software using LEDs. The team is motivated to continue next week's work with the LEDs and to look for a way to create a library for the NFC software.
