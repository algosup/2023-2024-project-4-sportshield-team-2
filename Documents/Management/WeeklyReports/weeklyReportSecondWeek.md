## Week Z (18-22 March 2024)

The second week was dedicated to test all the component of the project. The team discuss about project and how we will succeed to produce the project without the hardware working. The functional specifications document was finished. The team also continue to reverse-engineer the existing software with LEDs to try to implement all functionalities of the project.

## Topics of the week

1. Test all the component.
2. Meeting with the client to discuss about the hardware.
3. Finishing to write functional specification.
4. continue to reverse engineering of the existing software with LEDs.
5. Try to implement functionalities of the project without the hardware working but with LEDs.

## Achievements

1. Test all the component.
    - The team has tested all the components.
    - The team has found some problems with the hardware components.
    - The team has decided to use LEDs to test the functionalities of the project.

2. Documents
    - The technical specifications are well advanced.
    - The test plan is well advanced.
    - The user manual has been continued with the information we had.

3. Hardware components
    - The team has received all the hardware components.
    - The team has tested the hardware components.
    - The team has continued to work on the hardware components.

4. Reverse engineering
    - The team has continued to reverse engineer the existing software with LEDs that permits to test the functionalities of the project.

## Challenges

1. Hardware part
    - The team had some trouble with the hardware, as the components were not working as expected.
    - The team decided to take other components that were working properly.
    - Also certain functions in the code were not working as expected.
2. Reverse engineering
    - The team had some trouble with the reverse engineering of the existing software mainly because of the hardware components.
3. Working for a real company
    - For some of the team members, it was their first time working for a real company, so it's different for them but they are adapting.

## Next week's plan

1. Documents
    - Finish the technical specifications document on Tuesday.
    - Continue the test plan.
    - Continue the user manual.
    - Begin the statement of work.

2. Hardware components
    - The team will continue to work on the hardware components with LEDs.

## Conclusion

The second week was a bit complicated with the problems of hardware but we tried to solve them with LEDs to simulate each state apart for the battery. The team has continued to work on the documents in particular for the technical and the test plan. The team has also started to reverse-engineer the existing software with LEDs. The team is motivated to continued the next week the work with LEDs and looking for a way to create a library for the NFC software.
