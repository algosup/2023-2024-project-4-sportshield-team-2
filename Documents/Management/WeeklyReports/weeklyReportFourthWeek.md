# FourthWeeklyReport

[Cumulative Weekly Reports](mainWeeklyReport.md)

## Week 4 (2-5 April 2024)

The fourth week was a shorter week due to the 1st of April. The team continued to work with LEDs to simulate the project's functionality. The team also continued to work on the test plan and the user manual.

## This week's topics

1. Continue to Manage each component with LEDs.
2. Continue to write the test plan.
3. Continue to write the user manual.
4. Continue to attempt to implement project functionality without hardware but with LEDs.

## Achievements

1. Manage each component with LEDs
   - During this week, the team continued to simulate the functionality of each component with LEDs.
   - The team managed to simulate the functionality of the electromagnet, the buzzer but not the NFC antenna because it was not possible to simulate the NFC antenna with LEDs.

2. Documents
   - The test plan is nearly finished.
   - The user manual is nearly finished.

3. Hardware components
   - As we said in the previous week, the team didn't manage to solve the hardware problems, so they decided to use LEDs to simulate the functionality of the project. So the team continued to work with LEDs.

4. Reverse engineering
   - The team continued to reverse-engineer the existing software using LEDs to test the project's functionality.
5. GitHub actions and server
   - The team managed to set up the GitHub actions and the server to automate the tests and check the code quality.

## Challenges

The challenges encountered this week are still the same as the previous week. The team tried to solve the hardware problems without success. The team continued to work with LEDs to simulate the project's functionality.

## Next week's plan

1. Documents
   - Finish the test plan on Wednesday.
   - Finish the user manual on Wednesday.

2. Hardware components
   - We decide to not use hardware components so the team will continue to work with LEDs to simulate the project's functionality.
3. Code
    - Finish the code to simulate the functionality of the project with LEDs.

## Conclusion

The fourth week was short, the team continued to simulate the functionality of each component with LEDs. The team also managed to finish the documentation like the test plan and the User manual. The team is motivated to continue next week's work with the LEDs. The team is looking forward to the next week to finish the work properly despite the hardware problems.
