## Robustness Assurance

Since the SportShield is an anti-theft device, it has to be resistant enough, meeting some resistance criteria.
<!-- Waterproofness, cold-resistance, and robustness against break-in attempts. -->

### Anti-theft Cable

The cable in itself got some adjustments to meet the resistance criteria. <br><br>
For physical security, we implemented a multi-layered cable and electromagnetic lock.<br>
Moreover, the cable automatically retracts into the housing and prevents unwinding when locked.
